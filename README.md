#### Gruppe 18 - HTW BERLIN 

 
In the era of internet shopping and dining, online reviews play a pivotal role in the customers' decision-making process.

According to a 2016 Yelp-specific study, a one-star improvement in Yelp rating can help restaurants increase their revenues by 9%<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>.
Given the importance of online reviews for the hospitality industry, fake reviews detection is a great concern for restaurant owners. While the means to detect them are fairly limited, there have been several approaches to the topic. 
While some research relies heavily on metadata in order to detect potential fake reviews, some studies have focused on sentiment analysis and the disparity between the sentiment score of a given review and  the numeric rating (1 to 5) attached to the reviews.
This pattern of inconsistency between rating and the sentiment conveyed in a given review has been found to be more frequent with fake reviews.<sup>[2](#myfootnote1)</sup>.
